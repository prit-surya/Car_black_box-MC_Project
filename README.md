Car Black Box Project


Project Overview


The Car Black Box is designed to track and log critical activities during a car's operation. Similar to a flight data recorder, it monitors important parameters such as gear shifts, current speed, engine temperature, fuel consumption, and trip distance. This data is logged in real-time, allowing transport managers to review the vehicleâ€™s activity, helping to enforce rules and ensure efficient vehicle use. The system provides password-based access for managers to view or download logs when necessary.
